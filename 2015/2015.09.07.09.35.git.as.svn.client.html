<h1 class="title">Using Git as SVN client</h1>

<p>When I switched over to Git, the feature I loved most was the 
possibility of creating local branches. With SVN I used to create and 
apply patches on my project if I needed to switch from implementing a 
complex feature to quickly fixing a bug. Of course, a patch does not 
have any progress history and merging it back into the main project can 
become difficult as the code base progresses. Merging Git local branches
 can also be difficult if the feature branch diverges for too long from 
the main branch, but you have a local development history and most of 
the time you will be able to painlessly rebase the feature branch on the
 main branch.</p>

<h2 id="checking-out-an-svn-project-with-git">Checking out an SVN project with Git</h2>

<p>You will need the address of the SVN repository for this; let’s say 
the address is “http://svn.yourserver.com/repos/trunk/yourproject”. The 
command you need to run is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git svn clone http://svn.yourserver.com/repos/trunk/yourproject
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are checking out a large project, with a long history, you may
 have to wait a while for this command to finish executing. Git converts
 the whole SVN project history into its own format locally. I’ve 
sometimes had to wait for over 9 hours for this clone action to finish. 
Make sure your computer won’t go to sleep and leave it running over 
night.</p>

<p>Once you have a local copy of the project, edit or add your 
“.gitignore” file in the root folder of the project. Exclude from 
versioning target folder, IDE project files, package files; like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*.class

# Package Files #
*.war
*.ear
/bin
/build
/.gradle
*target*
*/.idea/*
/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea
*.iml
.gitignore
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="updating-local-repository">Updating local repository</h2>

<p>To download the latest SVN changes to your local Git project, use the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git svn rebase
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may want to make sure you are on the master branch before doing 
this, so you can also run this command before rebasing the project:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout master
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="checking-in">Checking in</h2>

<p>To check in your local commits to the SVN repository, run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git svn dcommit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This operation may also take a while, depending on how many changes 
you have locally. Make sure your master branch is synced with the SVN 
repository before you commit any changes.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-private-branches">Working with private branches</h2>

<p>When you start working on a new task, you can create a private branch for that task:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout -b nameForNewTaskBranch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can now work on this branch, commit as many changes as you like, 
and quickly switch to the master branch when you need to handle some 
other task, like an urgent bug fix.</p>

<p>Once your new task is done, you can merge your private branch back 
into the main branch and send your changes to the SVN repository. You 
can do this in two ways: rebase your changes or merge your changes.</p>

<p>The rebase approach will move the commits on your private branch on 
the top of the master branch. First you must check out the master branch
 and update it. After the master branch is up to date, you must switch 
back to the private branch. Now you have to rebase the changes in your 
private branch on top of the master branch. Once this is done, switch 
back to the master branch and merge the master branch with your private 
branch. This operation will “fast-forward” your master branch (bringing 
the head of the master branch) to your latest commit. Now you can check 
in the code to SVN.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout master
git svn rebase
git checkout nameForNewTaskBranch
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge nameForNewTaskBranch
git svn dcommit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second approach is to merge your master branch with the private 
branch. Merging will move the private branch commits to the master 
branch while keeping the chronological of private and master branch 
commits (the commits will interweave). I favor the rebase approach and 
that is the approach I have used. Possible conflict resolution can be 
easier when you place all your commits on top of the existing code, 
while the merge approach can bring out multiple conflinct points across 
the history of the project codebase. But if you still want to do a merge
 you won’t have to go through so many steps as for the rebase approach. 
First update your master branch, then you can merge the master branch 
with the private branch, and finally check in to SVN.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout master
git merge nameForNewTaskBranch
git svn dcommit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is all there is to it. It’s possible to still have local private
 branches even if you’re using SVN as your versioning control system.</p>
