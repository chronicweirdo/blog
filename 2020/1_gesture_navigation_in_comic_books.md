# Gesture navigation in comic books

- about the new app

In the last couple if months I've spent some of
my time on a very specific project: develop a 
web-based cross-device comic, and eventually ebook, 
reader app than gives me access to my comics and 
books collection from anywhere. After many hours
of implementation and testing, the project is a
success and it is released [here](www).

- objectives when designing the gestures: simple, cross-device support for clicks, gestures, keyboard
- required functionality: prev, next, designed for both pages or views, zoom and pan, jump to specific page
