I'm not a designer, obviously. I do like playing around with designing stuff from time to time, it's relaxing. It can also be frustrating. I'll usually "sleep on it" for several nights before I decide if a logo I created is OK.

One such play-project was designing a logo for my twitter account. I already found a name, a fortuitous moment when I had the idea of calling my account "tweettotaller". A play on the ["teetotaller"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism) concept, I probably had this idea first when I realized I was somewhat a teetotaller. I won't forcibly abstain from alcohol, I have no moral objection to drinking and I don't think doing 

I'm not on twitter anymore, it gave me the impresion I'm shouting bursts in a waste.
